calculator calculating arithmetics, its becoming quite fun i must say

## todo
- = if num is empty, repeat last operation on the current number
- display num op num =
- display overflow horizontal scroll
- if a == str && op == '=' && b == number, add str to a global variables object
- display obj
- pixel like screen (maybe dom draw?), probably just grid green background plus calculator font
- keyboard also triggers buttons :focus
- make it draggable "transform: translate(-169px, -7px);" + Mouse position, mouse down and mouseup listeners?
